#SecRE

SecRE is a networked system for efficient encrypted video delivery while preserving the benefits of in-network caching. This is a prototype for the performance evaluations in our paper "Enabling Secure and Efficient Video Delivery through Encrypted In-network Caching". 

The prototype contains three components:

* Request handler; 
* Cache-enabled router;
* User client.
