#SecRE
=====

SecRE is a new networked system for efficient 
encrypted video delivery while preserving the benefits
of in-network caching. This is a prototype that implements the experiment of our research on "Enabling Secure and Efficient Video Delivery through Encrypted In-network Caching". Keywords : Secure video delivery, encrypted in-network caching, secure redundancy elimination.

It mainly includes two parts experimental evaluation : the performance of the encrypted fingerprint index and the performance of secure video delivery with RE support.

this implementation includes three parts. the encrypted fingerprint index is written in C++ and uses [Openssl library] [1], it support query operations in .
